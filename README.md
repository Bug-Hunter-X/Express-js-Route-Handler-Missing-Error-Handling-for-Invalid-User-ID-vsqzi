# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to fetch a user based on an ID provided in the route parameters.  However, it fails to handle the scenario where the ID is not a valid integer, which can lead to unexpected errors or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code with improved error handling.

## Bug
The main issue is the absence of error handling when `req.params.id` cannot be parsed as an integer or when no user is found with the given ID.  This can result in unexpected behavior, including application crashes or inconsistent responses.
